EDO is a tool for selecting Ensemble-Diversity Optimised hairpins used as
barcodes in the context of high throughput synthesis pipelines, like Cloud Lab
(see http://daslab.stanford.edu/das_research.html)

Partition functions are computed using the ViennaRNA package.

Build the usual way:

  ./configure
  make

and then try

  src/edo -v < data/r89f.list >data/r89f.seqs
  src/edo --eval < data/r89f.seqs
